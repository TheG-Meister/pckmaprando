The project is still in its infancy, and therefore many elements are rough around the edges. Here's a few places to get started.

* Submit bugs, improvements and ideas to the [issues page](https://github.com/TheG-Meister/pkc-mms-rando/issues). If there's a particular part of the code you want documented, submit an issue and I'll get on it.
* Check out this repository's [contribute page](https://github.com/TheG-Meister/pkc-mms-rando/contribute) for a list of good first issues.
