# Pokecrystal Dissassembly Map, Music and Story Randomiser

pkc-mms-rando provides alternative randomisation options for Pokémon Crystal compared to a typical Pokemon randomiser.

## Capabilities

[v0.0.2](https://github.com/TheG-Meister/pkc-mms-rando/releases/tag/v0.0.2) offers the following randomisers.

### Shuffle music pointers

Replace all occurrences of each music track with a different one. Some tracks do not loop and leave silence afterwards, but nothing can be randomised to silence alone.

### Shuffle sound effect pointers

Replace all occurrences of each sound effect with a diffferent one. **Can greatly reduce game speed** if short, common sounds such as menu bleeps are replaced with long battle sound effects.

### Shuffle warps

Shuffle destinations of selected warps. In this version, all warps that lead to or from gatehouses, caves, train stations and ports will now lead somewhere else. **Not always completable** and **the player can get stuck after hopping ledges**.

## Limitations

pkc-mms-rando is still early in development. It **cannot edit ROM files** and **has no user interface**. Instead, [v0.0.2](https://github.com/TheG-Meister/pkc-mms-rando/releases/tag/v0.0.2) randomisers are accessed from a command-line terminal, and read and write Pokémon Crystal disassembly files. Fortunately, options for a full user interface and direct ROM editing are planned. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nE5nZVqgkE) for update notifications.
